10 June 2023 - finally documenting have been doing since last week

Instructions on Setting Up F1TENTH Jetson
can be found on https://f1tenth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/intro.html

f1tenth was prebuild with given electrical connections

electronics used:
VESC
Lidar LD06

something I did differently from f1tenth is:
1. Using Jetson Nano
in the download center, I searched for Jetson Nano Developer Kit SD card image instead
in result I got ubuntu 18.04 
Drawbacks: can't install ros2 on the jetson, have to use docker

2. Using Lidar LD06: https://github.com/linorobot/ldlidar/tree/ros2
I am still figuring out how to integrate to the launch file
but for now try to git clone and install (if not possible to login try to fork it in your own repository and clone that
change the usb settings because in f1tenth use special serial_port name

change src/ldlidar/ldlidar.rules
and change src/ldlidar/src/ldlidar_node.cpp

there is a "TODO" in line 7 put that in there


TO DO:
- get rid of urg node ld action
- Make URDF file for SLAM Toolbox but unlikely to fix odom to base link
